## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run lint`

Launches a command line linter using the projects lint configurations found in
the .eslintrc.yaml file.

### `npm run coverage`

Launches the test runner with coverage report option. Fence levels for various coverage metrics are
configured in package.json file. Reports are generated in a /coverage folder.

### `npm run flow`

Launches the flow server from the node_modules dependency for the project.

## Displaying Lint Output in the Editor

>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.0` and higher.

Some editors, including Sublime Text, Atom, and Visual Studio Code, provide plugins for ESLint.

They are not required for linting. You should see the linter output right in your terminal as well as the browser console. However, if you prefer the lint results to appear right in your editor, there are some extra steps you can do.

You would need to install an ESLint plugin for your editor first.

>**A note for Atom `linter-eslint` users**

>If you are using the Atom `linter-eslint` plugin, make sure that **Use global ESLint installation** option is checked:

><img src="http://i.imgur.com/yVNNHJM.png" width="300">

Finally, you will need to install some packages *globally*:

```sh
npm install -g eslint-config-react-app@0.3.0 eslint@3.8.1 babel-eslint@7.0.0 eslint-plugin-react@6.4.1 eslint-plugin-import@2.0.1 eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y@2.2.3 eslint-plugin-flowtype@2.21.0
```

We recognize that this is suboptimal, but it is currently required due to the way we hide the ESLint dependency. The ESLint team is already [working on a solution to this](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/3458) so this may become unnecessary in a couple of months.

## Installing a Dependency

Install dependencies (for example, React Router) with `npm`:

```
npm install --save <library-name>
```

```
npm install --save-dev <library-name>
```

## Importing a Component

This project setup supports ES6 modules thanks to Babel.<br>
While you can still use `require()` and `module.exports`, we encourage you to use [`import` and `export`](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html) instead.

For example:

### `Button.js`

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Button extends Component {
  render() {
    // ...
  }
}

export default Button; // Don’t forget to use export default!
```

### `DangerButton.js`


```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import Button from './Button'; // Import a component from another file

class DangerButton extends Component {
  render() {
    return <Button color="red" />;
  }
}

export default DangerButton;
```

Be aware of the [difference between default and named exports](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36795819/react-native-es-6-when-should-i-use-curly-braces-for-import/36796281#36796281). It is a common source of mistakes.

We suggest that you stick to using default imports and exports when a module only exports a single thing (for example, a component). That’s what you get when you use `export default Button` and `import Button from './Button'`.

Named exports are useful for utility modules that export several functions. A module may have at most one default export and as many named exports as you like.

* [Exploring ES6: Modules](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html)
* [Understanding ES6: Modules](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read#leanpub-auto-encapsulating-code-with-modules)

## Using CSS Modules

A CSS Module is a CSS file in which all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default.
[CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) using SASS syntax have been implemented.

For example, this:

```Content.scss
.drawer {
  margin: 0 auto;
  font-size: 0.75rem;
}

.content {
  overflow-x: hidden;
  margin-top: 60px;
  margin-left: 20px;
  padding: 20px;
  font-size: 1.0em;

  img {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto
  }

  li {
    margin-bottom: 10px
  }
  ol, ul {
    padding-left: 25px
  }
}
```

Is Refenced in the component:

```Context.js
...
import styles from './Content.scss'
```

and bound to an element via:

```
<div className={ styles.drawer } >
```

## Adding Images and Fonts

With Webpack, using static assets like images and fonts works similarly to CSS.

You can **`import` an image right in a JavaScript module**. This tells Webpack to include that image in the bundle. Unlike CSS imports, importing an image or a font gives you a string value. This value is the final image path you can reference in your code.

Here is an example:

```js
import React from 'react';
import logo from './logo.png'; // Tell Webpack this JS file uses this image

console.log(logo); // /logo.84287d09.png

function Header() {
  // Import result is the URL of your image
  return <img src={logo} alt="Logo" />;
}

export default Header;
```

This ensures that when the project is built, Webpack will correctly move the images into the build folder, and provide us with correct paths.

This works in CSS too:

```css
.Logo {
  background-image: url(./logo.png);
}
```

Webpack finds all relative module references in CSS (they start with `./`) and replaces them with the final paths from the compiled bundle. If you make a typo or accidentally delete an important file, you will see a compilation error, just like when you import a non-existent JavaScript module. The final filenames in the compiled bundle are generated by Webpack from content hashes. If the file content changes in the future, Webpack will give it a different name in production so you don’t need to worry about long-term caching of assets.

Please be advised that this is also a custom feature of Webpack.

**It is not required for React** but many people enjoy it (and React Native uses a similar mechanism for images).<br>
An alternative way of handling static assets is described in the next section.

## Using the `public` Folder

>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.5.0` and higher.

Normally we encourage you to `import` assets in JavaScript files as described above. This mechanism provides a number of benefits:

* Scripts and stylesheets get minified and bundled together to avoid extra network requests.
* Missing files cause compilation errors instead of 404 errors for your users.
* Result filenames include content hashes so you don’t need to worry about browsers caching their old versions.

However there is an **escape hatch** that you can use to add an asset outside of the module system.

If you put a file into the `public` folder, it will **not** be processed by Webpack. Instead it will be copied into the build folder untouched.   To reference assets in the `public` folder, you need to use a special variable called `PUBLIC_URL`.

Inside `index.html`, you can use it like this:

```html
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico">
```

Only files inside the `public` folder will be accessible by `%PUBLIC_URL%` prefix. If you need to use a file from `src` or `node_modules`, you’ll have to copy it there to explicitly specify your intention to make this file a part of the build.

When you run `npm run build`, Create React App will substitute `%PUBLIC_URL%` with a correct absolute path so your project works even if you use client-side routing or host it at a non-root URL.

In JavaScript code, you can use `process.env.PUBLIC_URL` for similar purposes:

```js
render() {
  // Note: this is an escape hatch and should be used sparingly!
  // Normally we recommend using `import` for getting asset URLs
  // as described in “Adding Images and Fonts” above this section.
  return <img src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + '/img/logo.png'} />;
}
```

Keep in mind the downsides of this approach:

* None of the files in `public` folder get post-processed or minified.
* Missing files will not be called at compilation time, and will cause 404 errors for your users.
* Result filenames won’t include content hashes so you’ll need to add query arguments or rename them every time they change.

However, it can be handy for referencing assets like [`manifest.webmanifest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest) from HTML, or including small scripts like [`pace.js`](http://github.hubspot.com/pace/docs/welcome/) outside of the bundled code.

Note that if you add a `<script>` that declares global variables, you also need to read the next section on using them.

## Using Global Variables

When you include a script in the HTML file that defines global variables and try to use one of these variables in the code, the linter will complain because it cannot see the definition of the variable.

You can avoid this by reading the global variable explicitly from the `window` object, for example:

```js
const $ = window.$;
```

This makes it obvious you are using a global variable intentionally rather than because of a typo.

Alternatively, you can force the linter to ignore any line by adding `// eslint-disable-line` after it.

## Adding Custom Environment Variables

>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.3` and higher.

Your project can consume variables declared in your environment as if they were declared locally in your JS files. By
default you will have `NODE_ENV` defined for you, and any other environment variables starting with
`REACT_APP_`. These environment variables will be defined for you on `process.env`. For example, having an environment
variable named `REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE` will be exposed in your JS as `process.env.REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE`, in addition
to `process.env.NODE_ENV`.

>Note: Changing any environment variables will require you to restart the development server if it is running.

These environment variables can be useful for displaying information conditionally based on where the project is
deployed or consuming sensitive data that lives outside of version control.

First, you need to have environment variables defined. For example, let’s say you wanted to consume a secret defined
in the environment inside a `<form>`:

```jsx
render() {
  return (
    <div>
      <small>You are running this application in <b>{process.env.NODE_ENV}</b> mode.</small>
      <form>
        <input type="hidden" defaultValue={process.env.REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE} />
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

During the build, `process.env.REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE` will be replaced with the current value of the `REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE` environment variable. Remember that the `NODE_ENV` variable will be set for you automatically.

When you load the app in the browser and inspect the `<input>`, you will see its value set to `abcdef`, and the bold text will show the environment provided when using `npm start`:

```html
<div>
  <small>You are running this application in <b>development</b> mode.</small>
  <form>
    <input type="hidden" value="abcdef" />
  </form>
</div>
```

Having access to the `NODE_ENV` is also useful for performing actions conditionally:

```js
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  analytics.disable();
}
```

The above form is looking for a variable called `REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE` from the environment. In order to consume this
value, we need to have it defined in the environment. This can be done using two ways: either in your shell or in
a `.env` file.

### Adding Temporary Environment Variables In Your Shell

Defining environment variables can vary between OSes. It's also important to know that this manner is temporary for the
life of the shell session.

#### Windows (cmd.exe)

```cmd
set REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE=abcdef&&npm start
```

(Note: the lack of whitespace is intentional.)

#### Linux, OS X (Bash)

```bash
REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE=abcdef npm start
```

### Adding Development Environment Variables In `.env`

>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.5.0` and higher.

To define permanent environment variables, create a file called `.env` in the root of your project:

```
REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE=abcdef
```

These variables will act as the defaults if the machine does not explicitly set them.<br>
Please refer to the [dotenv documentation](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) for more details.

>Note: If you are defining environment variables for development, your CI and/or hosting platform will most likely need
these defined as well. Consult their documentation how to do this. For example, see the documentation for [Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/) or [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars).

## Can I Use Decorators?

Many popular libraries use [decorators](https://medium.com/google-developers/exploring-es7-decorators-76ecb65fb841) in their documentation.<br>
Create React App doesn’t support decorator syntax at the moment because:

* It is an experimental proposal and is subject to change.
* The current specification version is not officially supported by Babel.
* If the specification changes, we won’t be able to write a codemod because we don’t use them internally at Facebook.

However in many cases you can rewrite decorator-based code without decorators just as fine.<br>
Please refer to these two threads for reference:

* [#214](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/214)
* [#411](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/411)

Create React App will add decorator support when the specification advances to a stable stage.

## Integrating with a Node Backend

Check out [this tutorial](https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/using-create-react-app-with-a-server/) for instructions on integrating an app with a Node backend running on another port, and using `fetch()` to access it. You can find the companion GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/fullstackreact/food-lookup-demo).

## Proxying API Requests in Development

>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.3` and higher.

People often serve the front-end React app from the same host and port as their backend implementation.<br>
For example, a production setup might look like this after the app is deployed:

```
/             - static server returns index.html with React app
/todos        - static server returns index.html with React app
/api/todos    - server handles any /api/* requests using the backend implementation
```

Such setup is **not** required. However, if you **do** have a setup like this, it is convenient to write requests like `fetch('/api/todos')` without worrying about redirecting them to another host or port during development.

To tell the development server to proxy any unknown requests to your API server in development, add a `proxy` field to your `package.json`, for example:

```js
  "proxy": "http://localhost:4000",
```

This way, when you `fetch('/api/todos')` in development, the development server will recognize that it’s not a static asset, and will proxy your request to `http://localhost:4000/api/todos` as a fallback. The development server will only attempt to send requests without a `text/html` accept header to the proxy.

Conveniently, this avoids [CORS issues](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21854516/understanding-ajax-cors-and-security-considerations) and error messages like this in development:

```
Fetch API cannot load http://localhost:4000/api/todos. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:3000' is therefore not allowed access. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
```

Keep in mind that `proxy` only has effect in development (with `npm start`), and it is up to you to ensure that URLs like `/api/todos` point to the right thing in production. You don’t have to use the `/api` prefix. Any unrecognized request without a `text/html` accept header will be redirected to the specified `proxy`.

Currently the `proxy` option only handles HTTP requests, and it won’t proxy WebSocket connections.<br>
If the `proxy` option is **not** flexible enough for you, alternatively you can:

* Enable CORS on your server ([here’s how to do it for Express](http://enable-cors.org/server_expressjs.html)).
* Use [environment variables](#adding-custom-environment-variables) to inject the right server host and port into your app.

## Using HTTPS in Development

>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.4.0` and higher.

You may require the dev server to serve pages over HTTPS. One particular case where this could be useful is when using [the "proxy" feature](#proxying-api-requests-in-development) to proxy requests to an API server when that API server is itself serving HTTPS.

To do this, set the `HTTPS` environment variable to `true`, then start the dev server as usual with `npm start`:

#### Windows (cmd.exe)

```cmd
set HTTPS=true&&npm start
```

(Note: the lack of whitespace is intentional.)

#### Linux, OS X (Bash)

```bash
HTTPS=true npm start
```

Note that the server will use a self-signed certificate, so your web browser will almost definitely display a warning upon accessing the page.

## Generating Dynamic `<meta>` Tags on the Server

Since Create React App doesn’t support server rendering, you might be wondering how to make `<meta>` tags dynamic and reflect the current URL. To solve this, we recommend to add placeholders into the HTML, like this:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta property="og:title" content="%OG_TITLE%">
    <meta property="og:description" content="%OG_DESCRIPTION%">
```

Then, on the server, regardless of the backend you use, you can read `index.html` into memory and replace `%OG_TITLE%`, `%OG_DESCRIPTION%`, and any other placeholders with values depending on the current URL. Just make sure to sanitize and escape the interpolated values so that they are safe to embed into HTML!

If you use a Node server, you can even share the route matching logic between the client and the server. However duplicating it also works fine in simple cases.

## Running Tests

>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.3.0` and higher.<br>
>[Read the migration guide to learn how to enable it in older projects!](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#migrating-from-023-to-030)

Create React App uses [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) as its test runner. To prepare for this integration, we did a [major revamp](https://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/09/01/jest-15.html) of Jest so if you heard bad things about it years ago, give it another try.

Jest is a Node-based runner. This means that the tests always run in a Node environment and not in a real browser. This lets us enable fast iteration speed and prevent flakiness.

While Jest provides browser globals such as `window` thanks to [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom), they are only approximations of the real browser behavior. Jest is intended to be used for unit tests of your logic and your components rather than the DOM quirks.

We recommend that you use a separate tool for browser end-to-end tests if you need them. They are beyond the scope of Create React App.

### Filename Conventions

Jest will look for test files with any of the following popular naming conventions:

* Files with `.js` suffix in `__tests__` folders.
* Files with `.test.js` suffix.
* Files with `.spec.js` suffix.

The `.test.js` / `.spec.js` files (or the `__tests__` folders) can be located at any depth under the `src` top level folder.

We recommend to put the test files (or `__tests__` folders) next to the code they are testing so that relative imports appear shorter. For example, if `App.test.js` and `App.js` are in the same folder, the test just needs to `import App from './App'` instead of a long relative path. Colocation also helps find tests more quickly in larger projects.

### Command Line Interface

When you run `npm test`, Jest will launch in the watch mode. Every time you save a file, it will re-run the tests, just like `npm start` recompiles the code.

The watcher includes an interactive command-line interface with the ability to run all tests, or focus on a search pattern. It is designed this way so that you can keep it open and enjoy fast re-runs. You can learn the commands from the “Watch Usage” note that the watcher prints after every run:

![Jest watch mode](http://facebook.github.io/jest/img/blog/15-watch.gif)

### Version Control Integration

By default, when you run `npm test`, Jest will only run the tests related to files changed since the last commit. This is an optimization designed to make your tests runs fast regardless of how many tests you have. However it assumes that you don’t often commit the code that doesn’t pass the tests.

Jest will always explicitly mention that it only ran tests related to the files changed since the last commit. You can also press `a` in the watch mode to force Jest to run all tests.

Jest will always run all tests on a [continuous integration](#continuous-integration) server or if the project is not inside a Git or Mercurial repository.

### Writing Tests

To create tests, add `it()` (or `test()`) blocks with the name of the test and its code. You may optionally wrap them in `describe()` blocks for logical grouping but this is neither required nor recommended.

Jest provides a built-in `expect()` global function for making assertions. A basic test could look like this:

```js
import sum from './sum';

it('sums numbers', () => {
  expect(sum(1, 2)).toEqual(3);
  expect(sum(2, 2)).toEqual(4);
});
```

All `expect()` matchers supported by Jest are [extensively documented here](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/api.html#expect-value).<br>
You can also use [`jest.fn()` and `expect(fn).toBeCalled()`](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/api.html#tobecalled) to create “spies” or mock functions.

### Testing Components

There is a broad spectrum of component testing techniques. They range from a “smoke test” verifying that a component renders without throwing, to shallow rendering and testing some of the output, to full rendering and testing component lifecycle and state changes.

Different projects choose different testing tradeoffs based on how often components change, and how much logic they contain. If you haven’t decided on a testing strategy yet, we recommend that you start with creating simple smoke tests for your components:

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

it('renders without crashing', () => {
  const div = document.createElement('div');
  ReactDOM.render(<App />, div);
});
```

This test mounts a component and makes sure that it didn’t throw during rendering. Tests like this provide a lot value with very little effort so they are great as a starting point, and this is the test you will find in `src/App.test.js`.

When you encounter bugs caused by changing components, you will gain a deeper insight into which parts of them are worth testing in your application. This might be a good time to introduce more specific tests asserting specific expected output or behavior.

If you’d like to test components in isolation from the child components they render, we recommend using [`shallow()` rendering API](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/shallow.html) from [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/). You can write a smoke test with it too:

```sh
npm install --save-dev enzyme react-addons-test-utils
```

```js
import React from 'react';
import { shallow } from 'enzyme';
import App from './App';

it('renders without crashing', () => {
  shallow(<App />);
});
```

Unlike the previous smoke test using `ReactDOM.render()`, this test only renders `<App>` and doesn’t go deeper. For example, even if `<App>` itself renders a `<Button>` that throws, this test will pass. Shallow rendering is great for isolated unit tests, but you may still want to create some full rendering tests to ensure the components integrate correctly. Enzyme supports [full rendering with `mount()`](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/mount.html), and you can also use it for testing state changes and component lifecycle.

You can read the [Enzyme documentation](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) for more testing techniques. Enzyme documentation uses Chai and Sinon for assertions but you don’t have to use them because Jest provides built-in `expect()` and `jest.fn()` for spies.

Here is an example from Enzyme documentation that asserts specific output, rewritten to use Jest matchers:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { shallow } from 'enzyme';
import App from './App';

it('renders welcome message', () => {
  const wrapper = shallow(<App />);
  const welcome = <h2>Welcome to React</h2>;
  // expect(wrapper.contains(welcome)).to.equal(true);
  expect(wrapper.contains(welcome)).toEqual(true);
});
```

All Jest matchers are [extensively documented here](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/api.html#expect-value).<br>
Nevertheless you can use a third-party assertion library like [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) if you want to, as described below.

### Using Third Party Assertion Libraries

We recommend that you use `expect()` for assertions and `jest.fn()` for spies. If you are having issues with them please [file those against Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/new), and we’ll fix them. We intend to keep making them better for React, supporting, for example, [pretty-printing React elements as JSX](https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/1566).

However, if you are used to other libraries, such as [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) and [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/), or if you have existing code using them that you’d like to port over, you can import them normally like this:

```js
import sinon from 'sinon';
import { expect } from 'chai';
```

and then use them in your tests like you normally do.

### Initializing Test Environment

>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.4.0` and higher.

If your app uses a browser API that you need to mock in your tests or if you just need a global setup before running your tests, add a `src/setupTests.js` to your project. It will be automatically executed before running your tests.

For example:

#### `src/setupTests.js`
```js
const localStorageMock = {
  getItem: jest.fn(),
  setItem: jest.fn(),
  clear: jest.fn()
};
global.localStorage = localStorageMock
```

### Focusing and Excluding Tests

You can replace `it()` with `xit()` to temporarily exclude a test from being executed.<br>
Similarly, `fit()` lets you focus on a specific test without running any other tests.

### Coverage Reporting

Jest has an integrated coverage reporter that works well with ES6 and requires no configuration.<br>
Run `npm test -- --coverage` (note extra `--` in the middle) to include a coverage report like this:

Note that tests run much slower with coverage so it is recommended to run it separately from your normal workflow.

### Continuous Integration

By default `npm test` runs the watcher with interactive CLI. However, you can force it to run tests once and finish the process by setting an environment variable called `CI`.

When creating a build of your application with `npm run build` linter warnings are not checked by default. Like `npm test`, you can force the build to perform a linter warning check by setting the environment variable `CI`. If any warnings are encountered then the build fails.

Popular CI servers already set the environment variable `CI` by default but you can do this yourself too:

### On CI servers
#### Travis CI

1. Following the [Travis Getting started](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/) guide for syncing your GitHub repository with Travis.  You may need to initialize some settings manually in your [profile](https://travis-ci.org/profile) page.
1. Add a `.travis.yml` file to your git repository.
```
language: node_js
node_js:
  - 4
  - 6
cache:
  directories:
    - node_modules
script:
  - npm test
  - npm run build
```
1. Trigger your first build with a git push.
1. [Customize your Travis CI Build](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/) if needed.

### On your own environment
##### Windows (cmd.exe)

```cmd
set CI=true&&npm test
```

```cmd
set CI=true&&npm run build
```

(Note: the lack of whitespace is intentional.)

##### Linux, OS X (Bash)

```bash
CI=true npm test
```

```bash
CI=true npm run build
```

The test command will force Jest to run tests once instead of launching the watcher.

>  If you find yourself doing this often in development, please [file an issue](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/new) to tell us about your use case because we want to make watcher the best experience and are open to changing how it works to accommodate more workflows.

The build command will check for linter warnings and fail if any are found.

### Disabling jsdom

By default, the `package.json` of the generated project looks like this:

```js
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    // ...
    "test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom"
  }
```

If you know that none of your tests depend on [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom), you can safely remove `--env=jsdom`, and your tests will run faster.<br>
To help you make up your mind, here is a list of APIs that **need jsdom**:

* Any browser globals like `window` and `document`
* [`ReactDOM.render()`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/top-level-api.html#reactdom.render)
* [`TestUtils.renderIntoDocument()`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html#renderintodocument) ([a shortcut](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/34761cf9a252964abfaab6faf74d473ad95d1f21/src/test/ReactTestUtils.js#L83-L91) for the above)
* [`mount()`](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/mount.html) in [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/index.html)

In contrast, **jsdom is not needed** for the following APIs:

* [`TestUtils.createRenderer()`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html#shallow-rendering) (shallow rendering)
* [`shallow()`](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/shallow.html) in [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/index.html)

Finally, jsdom is also not needed for [snapshot testing](http://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/07/27/jest-14.html). Longer term, this is the direction we are interested in exploring, but snapshot testing is [not fully baked yet](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/372) so we don’t officially encourage its usage yet.

### Experimental Snapshot Testing

Snapshot testing is a new feature of Jest that automatically generates text snapshots of your components and saves them on the disk so if the UI output changes, you get notified without manually writing any assertions on the component output.

This feature is experimental and still [has major usage issues](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/372) so we only encourage you to use it if you like experimental technology. We intend to gradually improve it over time and eventually offer it as the default solution for testing React components, but this will take time. [Read more about snapshot testing.](http://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/07/27/jest-14.html)

### Editor Integration

If you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), there is a [Jest extension](https://github.com/orta/vscode-jest) which works with Create React App out of the box. This provides a lot of IDE-like features while using a text editor: showing the status of a test run with potential fail messages inline, starting and stopping the watcher automatically, and offering one-click snapshot updates.

## Developing Components in Isolation

Usually, in an app, you have a lot of UI components, and each of them has many different states.
For an example, a simple button component could have following states:

* With a text label.
* With an emoji.
* In the disabled mode.

Usually, it’s hard to see these states without running a sample app or some examples.

Create React App doesn't include any tools for this by default, but you can easily add [React Storybook](https://github.com/kadirahq/react-storybook) to your project. **It is a third-party tool that lets you develop components and see all their states in isolation from your app**.

![React Storybook Demo](http://i.imgur.com/7CIAWpB.gif)

You can also deploy your Storybook as a static app. This way, everyone in your team can view and review different states of UI components without starting a backend server or creating an account in your app.

**Here’s how to setup your app with Storybook:**

First, install the following npm package globally:

```sh
npm install -g getstorybook
```

Then, run the following command inside your app’s directory:

```sh
getstorybook
```

After that, follow the instructions on the screen.

## Making a Progressive Web App

You can turn your React app into a [Progressive Web App](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) by following the steps in [this repository](https://github.com/jeffposnick/create-react-pwa).

## Deployment

`npm run build` creates a `build` directory with a production build of your app. Set up your favourite HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served `index.html`, and requests to static paths like `/static/js/main.<hash>.js` are served with the contents of the `/static/js/main.<hash>.js` file. For example, Python contains a built-in HTTP server that can serve static files:

```sh
cd build
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000
```

If you're using [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express](http://expressjs.com/) as a server, it might look like this:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');
const app = express();

app.use(express.static('./build'));

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, './build', 'index.html'));
});

app.listen(9000);
```
However this is not quite enough if you use client-side routing. Read the next section if you want to support URLs like `/todos/42` in your single-page app.

### Serving Apps with Client-Side Routing

If you use routers that use the HTML5 [`pushState` history API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API#Adding_and_modifying_history_entries) under the hood (for example, [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) with `browserHistory`), many static file servers will fail. For example, if you used React Router with a route for `/todos/42`, the development server will respond to `localhost:3000/todos/42` properly, but an Express serving a production build as above will not.

This is because when there is a fresh page load for a `/todos/42`, the server looks for the file `build/todos/42` and does not find it. The server needs to be configured to respond to a request to `/todos/42` by serving `index.html`. For example, we can amend our Express example above to serve `index.html` for any unknown paths:

```diff
 app.use(express.static('./build'));

-app.get('/', function (req, res) {
+app.get('/*', function (req, res) {
   res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, './build', 'index.html'));
 });
```

Now requests to `/todos/42` will be handled correctly both in development and in production.
